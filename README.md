# Multi-Resolution CNNs for Large-Scale Scene Recognition
This repo releases the code and models of team "SIAT_MMLAB" for several large-scale scene recogntion challenges.

Basically, we have made three efforts to exploit CNNs for large-scale scene recognition:
- We design a modular framework to capture multi-level visual information for scene understanding, called as MRCNN.
- We propose a knowledge disambiguation strategy to deal with the label ambiguity issue of scene recognition.
- We discover several good practices to train CNNs on existing datasets, like class balancing, hard sample mining.

The following report describes the technical detais of our method on these challenges:
